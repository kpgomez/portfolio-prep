1. I am a Process Improvement Enthusiast. 

2. I am passionate about learning how to use code to build applications that improve how we work. 

3. Hi, my name is Kiengchay Gomez and I am a Process Improvement Enthusiast. I go by KP for short and in case you are wondering, that is the initials of my maiden name. I am
a new mom and an aspiring RPA/software developer. I enjoy problem-solving, coming up with new and creative solutions, and figuring out how we can do it better without compromising on quality. I have a BBA in Information Systems, and my background is in Logistics, Project Management, and you guess it - Process Improvements. Besides code, my other main passion is playing pool. My husband and I are avid pool players. Although, it is well-known as a bar room activity, pool has helped me hone key skills such as discipline, patience, persistence, decision-making, and creative problem-solving.
